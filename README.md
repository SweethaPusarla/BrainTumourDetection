### Brain Tumor Detection

This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and classifying brain tumors using machine learning techniques. The primary focus is on analyzing MRI scans to identify the presence and type of brain tumors, such as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors.

Key features of the project include:

- **Data Preprocessing:** MRI images are converted to grayscale, resized, and normalized to ensure uniformity and improve model accuracy.
  
- **Model Training:** A machine learning model is trained on a labeled dataset of MRI scans, learning to distinguish between different classes of brain tumors and non-tumorous brain tissue.

- **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability in real-world scenarios.

- **Prediction Capability:** The model can predict the presence and type of brain tumor from new MRI images, providing a valuable tool for early diagnosis and treatment planning.

- **Deployment:** The project is designed for easy integration and deployment, making it accessible for use in clinical settings. A frontend interface, possibly built using Streamlit or Flask, allows users to upload MRI images and receive predictions in real-time.

This tool has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors more quickly and accurately, ultimately improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.
